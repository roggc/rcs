# RSC + SSR + RCC

This is an implementation from scratch of RSC (React Server Components) plus SSR (Server Side Rendering) plus RCC (React Client Components). There is a [Version 2](https://github.com/roggc/rsc-ssr-rcc-2) of this implementation with only one server. I recommend you to take a look at it too.

## How to install and run the project.

1. **npm i**
2. **npm run dev**
3. **npm run rsc** (in a new terminal window)
4. **npm run ssr** (in a new terminal window)
5. enter **localhost:8080** in the browser.
